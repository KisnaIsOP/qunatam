## Mathematical Foundations

### Wave Function (Ψ)
The wave function describes the quantum state of a particle:
```
Ψ(x,t) = Ae^(i(kx-ωt))
```
Where:
- A = amplitude
- k = wave number (k = 2π/λ)
- ω = angular frequency (ω = 2πf)
- x = position
- t = time
- ℏ = reduced Planck's constant (h/2π)

### Schrödinger Equation
The fundamental equation of quantum mechanics:
```
iℏ∂Ψ/∂t = ĤΨ
```
Where:
- i = imaginary unit
- ℏ = reduced Planck's constant
- Ĥ = Hamiltonian operator
- Ψ = wave function
- ∂/∂t = partial derivative with respect to time

### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
```
ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2
ΔEΔt ≥ ℏ/2
```
Where:
- Δx = uncertainty in position
- Δp = uncertainty in momentum
- ΔE = uncertainty in energy
- Δt = uncertainty in time

### De Broglie Wavelength
```
λ = h/p
```
Where:
- λ = wavelength
- h = Planck's constant
- p = momentum

## Key Quantum Concepts

1. Wave-Particle Duality
   - Particles exhibit both wave and particle properties
   - De Broglie wavelength: λ = h/p
   - Wave function collapse upon measurement

2. Quantum Superposition
   - |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
   - Quantum states exist in multiple states simultaneously
   - Probability amplitudes: |α|² + |β|² = 1

3. Quantum Entanglement
   - Bell States: |Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2
   - Non-local correlations
   - Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox
